PROJECT DETAILS 
1. Seismic Analysis and Design of RCC Structure Office Building 
(Dec 2023-Sep 2024) 
• Using dynamic analysis, the building's reaction to seismic forces was assessed. 
• A thorough understanding of building codes and earthquake design principles was gained. 
• Designed structural elements (beams, columns, slabs, staircase, lift shear walls, basement walls) to withstand seismic 
forces as per IS 1893(Part I):2016(Criteria for Earthquake Resistant Design of Structures), NBC 105:2020(Seismic Design 
of Buildings in Nepal), IS 456:2000(Code of Practice for Plain and Reinforced Concrete) and IS 13920:2016(Ductile Design 
and Detailing of Reinforced Concrete Structures Subjected to Seismic Forces). 
• Comparative study of results for design and analysis from IS 1893(Part I):2016 and NBC 105:2020. 
• Prepared detailed structural drawings and documentation. 
2. Hydraulic Ramp Pump (Hydram) for water supply and irrigation 
(Sept 2023-Oct 2023) 
• Conducted a suitability study of the hydraulic ramp pump for Nepal's context and prepared a functional working model 
to present in the “nec ingenium 2023” Batch wise and Program wise project exhibition. 
• Utilized the water hammer effect in the hydraulic ramp pump for water delivery without using electricity. 
3. Property Valuation for Land and Building in Dhangadi, Kailali 
(Mar 2023)
